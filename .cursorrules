- Real-time updates via WebSocket

## Code Style
- TypeScript for type safety
- React functional components with hooks
- Prisma for database access
- Express for API routes

## Architecture Patterns
- Component-based React architecture
- RESTful API design
- Real-time updates via Socket.io

## Key Business Rules
- Rating calculations based on point exchange rules
- Tournament types have different creation flows
- Organizers can create any match, Players can only create matches for themselves
- Snake draft algorithm for group formation

## Database Conventions
- Use Prisma schema for database structure
- Foreign keys with proper cascade rules
- Timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt) on relevant models

## UI Patterns
- Modal-based forms for creation
